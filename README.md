# Tracking_Assistant
Tracking assist is used to create a report from your google maps timeline.  It takes a list of relevant locations and reads data from your google timeline, then gives a report of when you arrived and when you left each relevant location.  It outputs the data to the screen, or the data can be outputted to an Excel file.

What I learned from writing this:
  
    • Version Management
  
    • How to maintain a larger database of code (1000+ lines across multiple files / directories)
  
    • How to write easily readible code (although I'll always trying to be improving this)
  
    • How to create / troubleshoot creating a GUI through tkinter
  
    • Troubleshooting bugs that span across several files or bugs that are with how your code communicates with the OS
  
    • The application of loose coupling / high cohesion
  
    • Design patterns (this program uses a micro services design pattern)
